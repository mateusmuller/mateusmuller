## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

This is Mateus! I'm currently working as a DevOps Engineer at Zeta Global. My tech stack includes Linux, Networking Fundamentals, Programming (Bash & Python), Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform, Ansible, EFK, Prometheus, Grafana and others.

What excites me about DevOps is the possibility to work with complex infrastructures, but automate pretty much everything on top of it ðŸ§¡.

During my spare time I like to break some k8s clusters on my homelab, hit the gym, watch netflix, gaming and spend time with my beloved ones.

I'm also a content creator, feel free to check it out:
